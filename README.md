## Setup

```sh

npm install
```

## Getting started


* [BlockProvider Development Guide](/BlockProvider-guide-fr.md)
* [BlockProvider Tutorial](/packages/blockprovider-tutorial-parkings)
* [Sample of BlockProvider](/packages/blockprovider-example)
* [Schemas documentation](/packages/documentation)


## Rules

- A block should not have it's own CSS, JS, fonts but leverage [SipaUI components](https://github.com/Ouest-France/SipaUI)

... if you really have to (and hope to pass our platform validation team)

- every CSS class names & ids must be prefixed by your block-provider name
- JavaScript code must not conflict with other code. Don't use global variables, your code will be wrapped inside a [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE).
- a block's JavaScript files will be concatained and loaded asynchronously
- a block-provider should respond in less 150ms, if you responsed not fast enough, your block won't be rendered 
- a block must be responsive (no fixed width)

## How do I update my block ?

Block are immutable â€” including their parameters configuration/templates/CSS/JS/fonts assets). If you update any part of it (e.g. change a CSS, a parameter, a template) then you will have to update the version number (follow [semver](https://semver.org)) and submit again the block-provider to the platform for validation
